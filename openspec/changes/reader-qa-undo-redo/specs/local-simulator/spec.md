## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Reproducible history sessions
The simulator SHALL drive the shared last-Q&A history state using declared undo/redo holds, departures/returns, new iterations and intervening edits. Reports SHALL expose transaction state, ordered events and exact page text. Faults SHALL exercise uncertain/partial mutation without silently claiming rollback. Source: planned src/simulator/scenario.rs; src/simulator/device.rs; tests/simulator.rs.

#### Scenario: Repeated toggle
- **WHEN** a scripted session accepts a Q&A and alternates valid undo/redo actions
- **THEN** only that block toggles, with no extra model calls and unchanged earlier page content.

#### Scenario: Invalidated session
- **WHEN** a page departure, new iteration or intervening edit invalidates the record
- **THEN** later history actions cannot revive it or mutate unrelated content.

#### Scenario: Partial operation
- **WHEN** a history mutation fault occurs
- **THEN** the report retains the actual failure state and history is discarded without an automatic retry.
